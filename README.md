# restClient

This repository is for a Class in University.

Class: Sistemas Computacionais Distribu√≠dos.
Project: This project is about to create a REST Client that consumes a REST API made by ourselves. However this client is not 
pretty, because it's running in Console. My next steps with this project is to create an friendly User Interface (I don't know if it's
in Java or React).
